# GOAL.md — Goal Engineering Reference Repo

This file documents how the **goal-engineering** reference repository maintains itself using goal patterns.

## Active Objective

Keep this repo the canonical, high-signal public reference for Grok Build CLI `/goal`.

## Done Condition

- [ ] OpenCode parity: `.opencode/skills/`, `opencode.jsonc`, `goal-init --tool opencode`, `goal-audit .opencode/skills` detection
- [x] README, API reference, and pattern catalog published
- [x] `goal-audit` CLI ships with G0–G3 scoring
- [x] Minimal goal starter + verifier skill included
- [x] GitHub Pages showcase + interactive pattern picker
- [x] `@cobusgreyling/goal-audit` live on npm
- [x] `goal-init` and `goal-cost` CLIs published
- [x] `@cobusgreyling/goal` unified meta CLI
- [x] Dogfood G3: `.grok/skills/`, `goal-run-log.md`, `SECURITY.md`
- [x] Expanded docs: anti-patterns, multi-goal, adopters, stories, FAQ, essay
- [x] Six pattern starters with pattern-specific verifiers
- [x] Golden-path replayable example
- [x] GitHub Action for goal-audit CI gates

## Deny List

- Changing unrelated user repos from this reference
- Publishing without LICENSE and CONTRIBUTING
- npm publish without version bump + tag workflow
