**Goal engineering is replacing one-shot prompts with verifiable, run-until-done objectives.** You define what "done" means, Grok Build works across turns until the condition holds — and reports progress via `/goal` and `update_goal`.

This is the **canonical public reference** for [Grok Build CLI](https://x.ai)'s `/goal` feature.

## The One-Line Definition

A **goal** is a single autonomous objective with a verifiable completion condition. Unlike a loop (which fires on a schedule), a goal **persists across turns** until Grok marks it complete, blocked, or you pause it.

```
Prompt  = one turn, one answer
Loop    = recurring discovery + triage on a cadence
Goal    = run until done (or blocked / paused)
```

## Quick Start (2 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Clone this reference
git clone https://github.com/cobusgreyling/goal-engineering.git
cd goal-engineering

# 2. Audit your project for goal readiness
npx @cobusgreyling/goal-audit . --suggest

# 3. In Grok Build CLI, set a goal
/goal All tests pass and auth module uses the new API
```

Manage the active goal:

```
/goal status    # check progress
/goal pause     # pause without clearing
/goal resume    # continue
/goal clear     # end goal mode
```

## Why Goals Matter

Most agent work fails in the gap between "looks done" and **actually done**. Goals close that gap:

1. **Persistence** — the objective survives compaction and new turns
2. **Progress telemetry** — `update_goal` logs status without spamming the chat
3. **Explicit lifecycle** — pause, resume, clear, blocked
4. **Verifiable completion** — you define the stop condition up front

Goals pair naturally with [loop engineering](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/loop-engineering): loops discover work; goals **finish** it.

## Grok Build API

| Surface | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/goal <objective>` | Set a new autonomous goal |
| `/goal status` | Show current goal state |
| `/goal pause` / `resume` | Pause or continue |
| `/goal clear` | Exit goal mode |
| `update_goal` tool | Agent reports progress (`message`), completion (`completed: true`), or blockers (`blocked_reason`) |

Full reference: [docs/api-reference.md](docs/api-reference.md)

**Availability:** `/goal` appears when the goal feature is enabled and `update_goal` is in the session toolset.

## The Four Primitives

| Primitive | Job in a Goal |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Objective** | One sentence + verifiable done condition |
| **Verifier** | Separate check — implementer must not grade its own homework |
| **State** | `GOAL.md` or equivalent external memory |
| **Budget** | Token/turn caps and kill switches |

Detail: [docs/primitives.md](docs/primitives.md) · Cross-tool matrix: [docs/primitives-matrix.md](docs/primitives-matrix.md)

## Patterns

| Pattern | When to use |
|---------|-------------|
| [Tests Green](patterns/tests-green.md) | CI red → green with verifier gates |
| [Migrate Module](patterns/migrate-module.md) | API/module migration with compatibility checks |
| [Implement Feature](patterns/implement-feature.md) | Scoped feature with acceptance criteria |
| [Fix Bug](patterns/fix-bug.md) | Repro → fix → regression test |
| [Refactor Safely](patterns/refactor-safely.md) | Behavior-preserving refactor with test lock |
| [Coverage Target](patterns/coverage-target.md) | Raise coverage to a threshold |

## Getting Started (5 minutes)

```bash
# Scaffold a pattern-ready project (recommended)
npx @cobusgreyling/goal-init . --pattern tests-green --tool grok

# Estimate turn/token spend
npx @cobusgreyling/goal-cost --pattern tests-green --level G2

# Audit readiness
npx @cobusgreyling/goal-audit . --suggest

# See scores climb
bash scripts/before-after-demo.sh
```

In Grok Build:

```
/goal Read GOAL.md. Implement the scoped objective. Run tests after each meaningful change.
Use update_goal for progress. Do not mark completed until the verifier skill passes.
```

See [starters/minimal-goal/](starters/minimal-goal/) and [docs/goal-design-checklist.md](docs/goal-design-checklist.md).

## Goal vs Loop

| | Goal | Loop |
|---|------|------|
| **Trigger** | You set an objective | Schedule (`/loop`) or automation |
| **Duration** | Until done / blocked / cleared | Recurring forever (or until cancelled) |
| **Best for** | Finish a bounded task | Discover + triage ongoing work |
| **State file** | `GOAL.md` | `STATE.md`, `LOOP.md` |
| **Grok command** | `/goal` | `/loop` + `scheduler_*` |

When to combine: a daily loop triages; when it finds a fixable item, **hand off to a goal** for run-until-done execution. See [docs/goal-vs-loop.md](docs/goal-vs-loop.md).

## Tools

| Tool | Command |
|------|---------|
| [goal-audit](tools/goal-audit/) | `npx @cobusgreyling/goal-audit . --suggest` |
| [goal-init](tools/goal-init/) | `npx @cobusgreyling/goal-init . --pattern tests-green --tool grok` |
| [goal-cost](tools/goal-cost/) | `npx @cobusgreyling/goal-cost --pattern fix-bug` |

Scores **Goal Readiness (G0–G3)** from signals: `GOAL.md`, `.grok/skills/`, verifier, test harness, done-condition checkboxes, `goal-run-log.md`.

## The Stack

| Layer | Unit | Question |
|-------|------|----------|
| Context Engineering | One inference | What does the model see? |
| Harness Engineering | One agent run | How does a single run execute safely? |
| **Goal Engineering** | One bounded objective | How do we run until verifiably done? |
| [Loop Engineering](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/loop-engineering) | Autonomous system over time | What keeps prompting on a cadence? |
| [Fleet Engineering](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/fleet-engineering) | Agent populations | How do many agents coordinate at scale? |
